This is a minimal 64-bit kernel implementation that runs on Xen. The purpose of this kernel is to be used as a compact environment that can be instantiated quickly and as a reference implementation for teaching activities at the University of St Andrews. It has a simple console and proivdes support for traps and a range of hypercalls. Some files have been ported and adapted from Xen/Mini-OS. Kindly note that designing the fundamental components of this kernel relied on some technical knowledge that can be found in [1].
